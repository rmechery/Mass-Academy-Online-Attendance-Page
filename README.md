# Mass Academy Online Attendance Page
 This repository contains code I developed to convert the attendance system at Mass Academy to an all digital format. The front-end is a web application written in HTML, Javascript, and Bootstrap. Firebase was used as the backend with all data being stored on a remote Firestore server.
